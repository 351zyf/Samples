{"name":"Samples","tagline":"Samples for Adobe Common Extensibility Platform (CEP)","body":"Sample extensions\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThese samples demonstrate techniques for building an extension with an HTML5 UI and behavior implemented in JavaScript. \r\n\r\nThese samples are still in development. Some of them use CEP 4 and the CC2013 version of the host app, and others are for CEP 5 and the new CC2014 version of the host application. You must have the host application installed to run an extension. Requirements for each sample are listed.\r\n\r\n* Supported host apps for CEP 5 include the CC2014 versions of: Dreamweaver, Flash Pro, InDesign, Illustrator, InCopy, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Prelude, and After Effects. \r\n* Support for the Flash/ActionScript extension model is deprecated in all apps, and has been removed from Photoshop CC2014.\r\n\r\n##Before running the samples\r\nThe samples provided are unsigned so this will cause the the signature check (built into CEP when first running an extension) to fail. To bypass the signature check, edit the CSXS preference properties file and add a new entry `PlayerDebugMode` of type \"string\" with the value of \"1\". This enables debug extensions to be displayed in the host applications. The CSXS preferences properties file is located at:\r\n```\r\nMac: /Users/<username>/Library/Preferences/com.adobe.CSXS.5.plist\r\nWin: regedit > HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Adobe/CSXS.5\r\n```\r\n----\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### CEP 5 extensions\r\n\r\n* [SimpleDissolve] (https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/simpledissolve)\r\n\t\r\n\t\tRequires CEP 5 and Photoshop CC2014\r\n\r\n* [WebGL with three.js (Contributed by Davide Deraedt)](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/webgl_threejs) : (description TBD)\r\n\r\n\t\tRequires CEP 5 and Photoshop CC2014\r\n\r\n*  [RSSReader](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/RSSReader) : Demonstrates using 3rd party NPM modules in a CEP 5 extension.\r\n\r\n\t\tRequires CEP 5 and CC2014 version of InDesign/InCopy, Illustrator, or Photoshop\r\n\r\n*  [ExchangeExample](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/ExchangeExample) : Demonstrates using the new Exchange APIs in a CEP 5 extension.
